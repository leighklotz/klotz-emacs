Installation instructions for etach:
------------------------------------

Important: Be sure to peruse all of the documentation (.txt) files and
back up your mail files before using etach, especially before using
the detach function.

1. Put the following into your emacs startup file, e.g., ~/.emacs:

     (load "~/elisp/etach")

   Modify the "~/elisp" part to match the directory in which
   etach.el resides.

2. Optionally, also put one or more of the following into your emacs
   startup file, e.g., ~/.emacs:

     (global-set-key "\C-c\C-f" 'find-file-at-point)
     (global-set-key "\C-c\C-u" 'browse-url-at-point)

     (define-key rmail-mode-map "F" 'mime-forward)
     (define-key rmail-summary-mode-map "F" 'mime-forward)

     (define-key rmail-mode-map "K" 'kill-label-detached)
     (define-key rmail-summary-mode-map "K" 'kill-label-detached)

   These define convenience key sequences for use in RMAIL mode.  The
   first two allow you to use C-c C-f and C-c C-u for more convenient
   visiting and browsing of detached files.  (Put the point on the
   detached file name and type C-c C-f, or keep an eye on your browser
   (Netscape?) window and type C-c C-u.)  The second two allow you to
   use F in place of f for mail forwarding when you want
   message/rfc822 formatting (as you probably do when forwarding mail
   with attachments).  If you get an error message about one of the
   mode-maps, you may need to put (require 'rmail) or (require
   'rmailsum) or (load "rmailsum") ahead of these lines.  The third
   pair allows you to type "K" to remove the "detached" attribute from
   a received mail message (this label is set on the current email
   message when the detach function is invoked).

   Of course, you can go further with the conveniences; the
   global-set-key and define-key invocations given above are just a
   few of the possibilities.  For instance, you may find (define-key
   rmail-mode-map "D" 'detach) and/or (define-key
   rmail-summary-mode-map "D" 'detach) to be useful.  Just be sure you
   don't presently use the key sequences originally associated with
   any of these mode/key combinations (check them via C-h k).

3. Optionally, also put one or more of the following into your startup
   file:

     (setq etach-prompt-me-for-file-names t)
     (setq etach-adjust-decoded-plain-text nil)

   (If you have a recent version of Emacs, you may prefer to use
   custom-set-variables instead.)  There are other customization
   options, too.  See the documentation for the variables beginning
   with "etach-" after completing the installation (C-h v etach- SPC),
   or grep for defcustom in etach.el.

After modifying your startup file you'll need to let Emacs know about
the changes; e.g., do an M-x eval-buffer, or just save the file and
restart emacs.

Please see the file INSTALL-TEST.txt for instructions on testing your
installation.

Please see the file README.txt for features and more information.

Please see the file FAQ.txt for frequently asked questions.

Please see the file CHANGELOG.txt for a record of changes from version
to version.

Enjoy!
