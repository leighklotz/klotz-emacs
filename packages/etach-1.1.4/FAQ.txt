----------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Where is etach?

A. You can find information on etach on the Web at:

     http://etach.sourceforge.net/

   You can download etach from:

     http://download.sourceforge.net/etach/

   You can view the etach project page and sign up for the
   new-version-notification mailing list via:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/etach/

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I've just retrieved etach.  What should I do?  Where should I
   begin?

A. Please read the file README.txt.  Next read INSTALL.txt, then
   INSTALL-TEST.txt.  If you're installing a replacement version, see
   CHANGELOG.txt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. To whom should I send bug reports, comments, and the like?

A. Please send email to the author: etach at rulnick dot com.  

   Please excuse the way I've written this email address, but it helps
   reduce the amount of spam I receive by confounding machines that
   read this file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Should I contact you if everything is working as expected?

A. Yes, please.  Just send a short message to etach at rulnick dot com
   saying something like "etach works for me" so I'll have an idea of
   the number of successful users.  I won't keep or use your
   information for any other purpose.  Thank you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Can etach handle multiple attachments, nested MIME parts, and the
   like?

A. Yes.  The more, the merrier.  And remember that M-x mime-forward
   (or just "F" if you set up the define-keys described in
   INSTALL.txt) is available for forwarding messages that contain
   attachments.  And you can add attachments to mime-forward'ed
   messages.  And you can continue adding text to the text/plain
   section(s) after attach'ing (just be sure to always leave a blank
   line between the Content- headers and your message text).  Etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I want to modify, or at least confirm, the file names used for
   detachments, and I want to be able to optionally cancel individual
   detachments.

A. O.K., add this (or equivalent custom-set-variables entry) to your
   startup file:

     (setq etach-prompt-me-for-file-names t)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I notice that etach fills (wraps long lines, etc.) and does some
   character translations (e.g., converting ^M newlines to "clean"
   (^J) newlines) on decoded inline plain text.  Can I change this?

A. Yes.  Add this (or equivalent custom-set-variables entry) to your
   startup file:

     (setq etach-adjust-decoded-plain-text nil)

   Actually, since fill-region (used when this variable is set to t)
   sometimes makes certain parts of the decoded text a little _less_
   readable, the nil setting sometimes produces easier-to-read
   results.  It is a matter of taste.  Setting
   etach-adjust-decoded-plain-text to nil instructs etach to just
   leave the text as it is.  (This setting does NOT affect detached
   files; it only affects text/plain matter displayed in place.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. How can I make etach work faster?

A. You can try byte-compiling:

     M-x byte-compile-file RET etach.el RET

   This will create the compiled Lisp file etach.elc, which will be
   loaded instead of etach.el if found by Emacs in the same directory
   (assuming you don't specify an extension in your load command).  Of
   course, you will therefore need to remember to delete the .elc file
   and/or re-compile when you install new versions of etach.  But
   etach's commands should operate quickly on almost any system, so I
   doubt byte-compilation will make a significant difference for most
   users.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I would like to include (or not include) all mail headers when I
   forward a message using mime-forward.  Is this possible?

A. Certainly.  Just toggle the headers (you should be able to do this
   with the "t" key, or M-x rmail-toggle-header) immediately before
   invoking mime-forward.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Can etach help me to deal with unsolicited mail messages?

A. Yes.  Just type C-u before invoking mime-forward (do this when
   viewing the unsolicited message in RMAIL mode).  Etach will do its
   best to construct a mail abuse report nearly ready to send.  You
   should edit the addresses (in many cases you will not want to send
   the spam report to all of the addresses in the default "To:" list
   established by mime-forward) and the message as appropriate, and
   then send it.  You can customize this functionality by setting
   variables like etach-spam-message, etach-spam-host-exclude-list,
   and etach-spam-message-subject-string.  At the very least you
   should add your local host and domain names to the
   etach-spam-host-exclude-list, i.e., put something like

     (setq etach-spam-host-exclude-list 
           '("localhost" "mydomain.com" "myhost.mydomain.com"))

   into your startup file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. How does etach decide which MIME parts to write to files and which
   to decode in place?

A. Loosely, if the MIME part headers specify that the content is
   text/plain and they provide no file name (name="..." or
   filename="...") then the part is decoded in place.  Otherwise the
   part is written to a file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I'm using an early version of Emacs 19 (or using Emacs 18, or 17,
   or...) and things aren't working.  What should I do?

A. Versions of etach prior to 1.1.2 were only partly functional on
   some versions of Emacs prior to Emacs 20.  Etach 1.1.2 included
   rewrites for, and testing under, Emacs 19.34.  If you are using the
   latest version of etach and are having problems with it under any
   version of Emacs, please let me know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Etach doesn't seem to work as expected.  What should I do?

A. Please send me a bug report.  Useful stuff to include in your
   message, if possible:

   - A description of the behavior you expected from etach, and the
     behavior you observed.

   - The version of etach you are using (M-x etach-version RET).

   - Your Emacs version (M-x version RET) and operating system.

   - The contents of your *Messages* buffer immediately after the
     problem or unexpected behavior occurs.

   - Emacs' debug messages, if you're getting an error message of some
     kind.  Please set the debug-on-error variable to t (M-x
     set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET) and then re-execute
     the sequence of commands that generates the error.  This should
     cause Emacs to produce a little bit of debugging information in a
     new buffer.  Please send me the contents of this buffer.

   - The mail message(s) that generate the problem.  Please include
     the headers, but of course do not include any personal or
     sensitive data.  (Please don't send any large file (>1MB)
     attachments unless they are necessary to demonstrate the
     unexpected or undesirable behavior in etach.)

   - The contents of the "etach-debug" buffer.  This is very useful,
     so please include it if you can.  In order to have an 
     etach-debug buffer you need to set the variable "etach-debug" to
     "t":

       M-x set-variable RET etach-debug RET t RET

     Then whenever you do an attach, detach, or mime-forward, a
     transcript of etach's operation will be written to the
     etach-debug buffer.  It is likely that without this information I
     will not be able to track down the problem, so please include the
     contents of the etach-debug buffer if at all possible.

   If you can't send all of these things, that's o.k.  Just send me
   whatever information you can about the problem.  Thanks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I sent myself a test message with an attachment, but "M-x detach"
   doesn't seem to have any effect on the received message.  Why are
   the attachments not detached?

A. First, check that the Content- headers (especially Content-Type and
   Content-Transfer-Encoding) are visible in the RMAIL buffer.  If
   not, Emacs may have hidden them according to the customizable
   variable rmail-ignored-headers (C-h v rmail-ignored-headers RET).
   You should take the expressions "^content-type:" and
   "^content-transfer-encoding:" (or "^content-.*:") out of your
   string of ignored headers in this case, probably via a
   custom-set-variables or setq directive in your startup file.  While
   it is in theory possible for me to modify etach to still work even
   when these headers are hidden, there are some tricky buffer and
   window display issues involved and, as a result, all of the methods
   I've tried have undesirable side effects.  So until I find another
   way, please make these headers visible by the method just
   described, or use the "t" key (or "M-x rmail-toggle-header") just
   before you detach.  (Also, note that Emacs may require you to
   toggle the headers on-and-off once for each existing message after
   editing the rmail-ignored-headers string.)

   It is also possible that the problem occurred on the sending side,
   and that another Emacs component is interfering with your MIME mail
   sending.  In particular, the Content-Type header may be modified by
   another component when you send mail.  (If this is the case, you
   will probably see a change in the headers from what they were when
   you sent the message; note the headers before you send, then switch
   back to the *mail* buffer after sending the message and have a
   look.)  To fix this, try putting the following into your startup
   file (e.g., ~/.emacs):

    (custom-set-variables
     '(mail-setup-hook nil)
     '(mail-send-hook nil))

   Reload the file (or restart emacs) and then try the
   attach/send/detach test again.  Of course, you'll want to replace
   "nil" above with any special non-trouble-causing hooks you may have
   installed -- but just plain nil should allow you to test whether
   something is interfering with etach's MIME message composition.

   If you want to have a careful look at the stuff that's getting
   loaded by emacs, see the load history:

     C-h v load-history RET

   If none of the above gets detach working, or if you have questions,
   please contact me with the details (see above).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I'm having trouble attaching or detaching one particular kind of
   file.  What is causing the problem?

A. Some file types have associated "hooks" in emacs -- functions that
   are called automatically in certain modes, for example.  It is
   possible that some hook is causing trouble.  Please see if there
   are any hooks being invoked when you visit or write files of the
   problem type.  If that doesn't help you fix the problem, please
   send a bug report (see above).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I get error messages saying that the function definition for
   base64-encode-region or base64-decode-region is void.  What's
   wrong?

A. These functions may not be provided in some versions of Emacs.  Do
   you have the command "mimencode" available on your system?  If so,
   try the following:

     M-x set-variable RET etach-use-mimencode RET t RET

   Then retry the attach or detach (whichever caused the error).  If
   it now works correctly, add the following or an equivalent
   custom-set-variables entry to your startup file:

     (setq etach-use-mimencode t)

   If you don't have mimencode, you will have to get it or upgrade
   Emacs so that the base64- functions are provided.  (I've received
   one report that the old "mmencode" works, too; if you have
   mmencode, you can use the above after linking mimencode to mmencode
   with with ln -s.)
